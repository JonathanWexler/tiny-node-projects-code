# Welcome to Tiny Node Projects

I'm happy to announce that my second book with Manning Publications Co. is available to read as part of the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP). MEAP allows you to start reading the book as new chapters roll out -- giving you an inside look to the development process and a voice to help shape the book's final form. Also, it's heavily discounted for a short time. The discount code is mlwexler2 (40% off Tiny Node Projects in all formats), and it's valid through September 20th.

#TinyNodeProjects is a collection of projects ranging from beginner to intermediate programming difficulty and dives into the process (literal #javascript process) behind the app. Each chapter in this book provides a unique perspective on app development with #nodejs and the industry-standard tooling you can use to build a useful tool from start to finish. Tiny Node Projects are not tutorials, but instead teach you about the inner workings of your project and how you can take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

I'll continue to post updates about the book here through official publication in Spring 2023. In the meantime, check the book out at http://mng.bz/49D5!
